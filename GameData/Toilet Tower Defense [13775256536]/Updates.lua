# Summer Event Part 2

## Beach Ball Hunt

Look around for beach balls! Find 10 in the lobby, 10 in the trading plaza, and 10 in game! The ones in game spawn on a specific wave - and disappear after 3 waves. 

The color of the background for the game beach balls corresponds to the difficulty! So green is easy, yellow is medium, red is hard, and purple is nightmare! Orange is other - so one beach ball is on Endless and one is on the summer map, Sand Isles!

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/07/image-2.png)

## Beach Ball Snake UGC

Find 15 beach balls to get the Sand Wizard Cameraman.

Find all 30 beach balls to get the beach ball snake! Only 50,000 copies exist - making it 8x rarer than the Toilet Pal and 4x rarer than Toilet Wings!

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/07/image-3.png)

## Sand Wizard Cameraman

This **Unncommon** Sand Wizard Cameraman summons tornados that do splash damage to attack toilets! He summons a tornado every time toilets are in his range, and it chases the toilets around!

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/07/RobloxScreenShot20240726_003519796.png)

## Aquatitan Speakerman

This **Godly** - Aquatitan Speakerman - is available in the Summer Crate at 0.01%! This crate is in the normal Summon Shop. **Luck Boosts affect this crate!**

He has a ton of water jets! The massive water jet in his torso can push toilets back. The ones on his shoulder and hands do tons of damage, and the ones on his back have crazy range!

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/07/image-5.png)

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/07/image-8.png)

## Giant Astro Spider Toilet

This toilet is the stronger version of the Astro Spider toilet. He's giant and shoots laser balls! This spawns on the much later waves of endless mode, but isn't a boss.

If you already have the unit, it will automatically change to the reworked version!

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/07/RobloxScreenShot20240720_111520914.png)

It is hard to create clans so not all good names get taken! Also, only 1 per 100 people needs to make a clan, since thats the member limit (maxed out).

Win matches or play endless to earn XP, strength, and clan coins for your clan!

Strength is your contribution to your current clan - leaving a clan will subtract your strength & it will start over if you rejoin / if you join a new clan.

Clan coins are used for upgrades.

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/08/image-9.png)

## Creating Clans

You can create clans by purchasing the Clan Creator gamepass (R$499) or by paying 100,000 Gems. **The gamepass lets you disband and remake a clan, but gems are a 1 time purchase so keep that in mind before disbanding a clan!**

Choose a name, tag, and image for your clan! Randomizing will select a random unit's picture for your clan!

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/08/image-10.png)

## Clan Directory

You can find clans with top strength / top level / most members here or search for other clans here! You can gain Clan Coins, Strength and Clan XP for your clan by playing any difficulty or endless!

This leaderboard updates every 5 minutes globally.

## Clan Home

This is your clan home. This shows your clan stats, member count, and most important information about your clan! Everything on here is visible to anyone, except the clan shout. The clan shout is used to communicate with your members and is only visible to them.

## Clan Members

A new update is here!

---

# 2x Match Speed

**ENDLESS MODE NOW HAS 2X SPEED!**

Turn it on when teleporting into a match - if you're the first person in the teleport (the person who gets the "Start" button menu) - and you have 2x speed unlocked - you can turn it on for your whole team!

The requirement is rank 10, but only one person in your team needs it!

This will be great to grind for clans, the endless board will take half the time, and it will help make the game easier for legit players VS bot farms - not many bots will get to rank 10 since we have a bit of time to find them!

This also essentially doubles the amount of rewards you get from endless mode once unlocked!

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/09/RobloxScreenShot20240907_010557861.png)

---

# Gadget Crate (Gem Crate)

This is a new Gem Crate in the Exclusive Shop! It contains 3 completely new types of units - so many balances changes may occur after it is added.

Expect small balances & improvements!

###### Odds:

- 60% - Static Speakerman
- 39.5% - Gravity Gun Cameraman
- 0.5% - Cage Scientist Clockman

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/09/image-1.png)

## Static Speakerman

This speakerman has the first static weapon!

When he shoots a toilet with it, a static line forms behind that toilet to other toilets in range, and it keeps going until one toilet is too far!

## Gravity Gun Cameraman

With a gravity gun, this cameraman shoots a gravity orb on the track!

Any toilets weaker than Dual Blade Toilet (<100,000 Strength : Strength = Base HP x Speed) are slowed by 75%!

## Cage Scientist Cameraman

This scientist makes cages to trap toilets!

Upgrading him makes the cage able to handle a higher strength of toilets.

Each cage has a strength limit of toilets it can hold - if the toilet that collides with it would make the cage go over the strength it can withhold, it will damage the cage.

Toilets can still be damaged while in the cage, and only get freed when the cage is broken!

---

# Others

## **Commander Cameraman (Exclusive)**

This cameraman commands large groups of cameramen to the skibidi war zone!

Starting with normal cameramen, unlocking large then titan cameraman, unlocking laser guns for cameramen, then finally upgrading all titans he spawns at max level, this is our first unit that spawns an army!

This will DEFINITELY be altered & balanced soon - we were short on time so we still need to alter some of his later levels! Right now he spawns things as a group, but they will be seperated with different damages/ranges within the next few days.

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/09/RobloxScreenShot20240907_124008665.png)

## **Clan Improvements**

- It now shows the member join date when Managing Clan Members
- You can now see how much strength a member gained today in the member list! Don't worry, you can still see the strength this week in Manage Members Tab.
- You can now deny all applications!
- Fixed Infinite Loading when trying to view applications!

## **Clan XP Buffs**

Clan Strength, XP and Coins has been buffed in some modes!

- Easy - 3 Strength
- Medium - 5 Strength
- Hard - 15 Strength
- Nightmare - 25 Strength
- Abysmal - 50 Strength

## **Improvements & Fixes**

- Purchases above 10k gems in the marketplace will now show a notification in chat for everyone to see!
- Fixed Upgraded Titan Cinemaman not appearing in Summon!

### Gun Pencilman (Rare - 39%)

This pencilman has a shotgun at his lower levels and upgrades to a smg with farther range at higher levels!

### Pencil Mech (Epic - 10%)

This is the friendly version of the pencil mech - he has a laser and a minigun!

The Rewards Update is here!

---

# Playtime Rewards

Earn rewards at certain times while playing - starting at just 5 minutes!

Earlier rewards give less cool stuff, but starting at 60 minutes, you can start getting Playtime Crates!

These crates can have one of two units:

- 99.9% - Hourglass Speakerman
- 0.1% - Eternal Clock Titan

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/09/image-7.png)

## Hourglass Speakerman

This speakerman places an hourglass by his side while he fights!

When the timer reaches 0, he gets **REALLY MAD** and punches one toilet super hard, dealing a ton of extra damage!

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/09/RobloxScreenShot20240921_135202293.png)

## Eternal Clock Titan

Not only can this clockman punch very hard and far away, but he can spawn death zones around the map!

The special zone he spawns slows toilets by 60% and makes then take 1/10 the damage of his punch every second spent in the zone.

The zone location is random and resets every minute!

Due to how powerful these zones are, only 3 Eternal Clock Titans can be placed at once. This limit may be increased or lowered depending on if it is too powerful or weak when it reaches the playerbase!

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/09/RobloxScreenShot20240921_135427555.png)

---

# Daily Rewards

The first 30 days you play Toilet Tower Defense, you can claim a reward!

If you miss a day it doesn't reset, but you will unlock that reward the next day you play.

Most of the time you only get coins, gems, or boosts. But, every 10th day, you get a special unit you can ONLY get from daily rewards!

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/09/image-8.png)

## **[DAY 10] Calendar Speakerman**

This speakerman has a pencil - he writes mean things to the toilets then throws the paper at them!

This makes the toilets take damage cause the paper is sharp. It also makes the toilets sad :(

## **[DAY 20] Stopwatch Cameraman**

Maxed out - this cameraman can freeze 4 toilets for five seconds (with a 10 second cooldown).

His freezing isn't that strong though, so this only works on toilets under 500k strength (anything weaker than Giant Dual Blade Toilet - will be easier to see toilet strength when we add toilet index in the near future).

Besides this attack, he doesnt have normal arms. He has BLADE ARMS!!

## **[DAY 30] Starfall TV Man**

This TV Man summons comets to deal splash damage to toilets!

At max level he can break parts of the track that will temporarily stop toilets under 5M strength (anything weaker than late wave endless bosses) while they have to repair the track!

The comets he summons also larger (and bigger blast radius) as you upgrade him!

---

# Others

## toilet man (Exclusive)

toilet man does NOT like toilets. they make him MAD!!!!!!!!!! 😠 😠 rarrrrrrrrrrrrrghhhh 😡 😡

the skibidi toilet gods have turned him into a toilet until he kills 1 skibidillion toilets then he can become a normal man again

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/09/RobloxScreenShot20240921_135516537.png)

## Titan Meatball Man Buff

Due to being pretty weak for his rarity as a new-ish unit, Titan Meatball Man is now about 18% cheaper to max out!

## Partner Launcher

Partners will now have access to a cool Partner Launcher, which can launch any crates!

When launched, these crates can be picked up by any players, and the crate will be transferred to you! Keep in mind if they are not picked up, they will decay after 30 seconds, and returned to the partner.

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/09/RobloxScreenShot20240921_104409571.png)

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Optimized Clans - Lobby & Trading Plazas should have less lag!

When the timer reaches 0, he gets **REALLY MAD** and punches one toilet super hard, dealing a ton of extra damage!

## Eternal Clock Titan

Not only can this clockman punch very hard and far away, but he can spawn death zones around the map!

The special zone he spawns slows toilets by 60% and makes then take 1/10 the damage of his punch every second spent in the zone.

The zone location is random and resets every minute!

Due to how powerful these zones are, only 3 Eternal Clock Titans can be placed at once. This limit may be increased or lowered depending on if it is too powerful or weak when it reaches the playerbase!

# Daily Rewards

The first 30 days you play Toilet Tower Defense, you can claim a reward!

If you miss a day it doesn't reset, but you will unlock that reward the next day you play.

Most of the time you only get coins, gems, or boosts. But, every 10th day, you get a special unit you can ONLY get from daily rewards!

## **[DAY 10] Calendar Speakerman**

This speakerman has a pencil - he writes mean things to the toilets then throws the paper at them!

This makes the toilets take damage cause the paper is sharp. It also makes the toilets sad :(

## **[DAY 20] Stopwatch Cameraman**

Maxed out - this cameraman can freeze 4 toilets for five seconds (with a 10 second cooldown).

His freezing isn't that strong though, so this only works on toilets under 500k strength (anything weaker than Giant Dual Blade Toilet - will be easier to see toilet strength when we add toilet index in the near future).

Besides this attack, he doesnt have normal arms. He has BLADE ARMS!!

## **[DAY 30] Starfall TV Man**

This TV Man summons comets to deal splash damage to toilets!

At max level he can break parts of the track that will temporarily stop toilets under 5M strength (anything weaker than late wave endless bosses) while they have to repair the track!

The comets he summons also larger (and bigger blast radius) as you upgrade him!

## Titan Meatball Man Buff

Due to being pretty weak for his rarity as a new-ish unit, Titan Meatball Man is now about 18% cheaper to max out!

## Partner Launcher

Partners will now have access to a cool Partner Launcher, which can launch any crates!

When launched, these crates can be picked up by any players, and the crate will be transferred to you! Keep in mind if they are not picked up, they will decay after 30 seconds, and returned to the partner.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Optimized Clans - Lobby & Trading Plazas should have less lag!

The Developer Crate + Drill Event Part 2 update is here!

---

# Developer Crate

This is a gem crate in the shop that has the 3 main developers of Toilet Tower Defense in it - Poolhail, iamEvan, and Telanthric!

###### Odds:

- 80% - Pool
- 20% - iamEvan
- 0.1% - Telanthric

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/10/image-1.png)

## Pool

## Telanthric

---

# Drill Event (Part 2)

This update also has the Drill Event Part 2!

## **Drill Forest**

Gives 100 drills, 250 XP, and 2 Drill Support Crates for winning!

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/10/RobloxScreenShot20241005_155141513.png)

## **Drill Support Crate**

Earn drill support crates from Drill World (1 per win) and Drill Forest (2 per win)!

You can get 3 units:

🎖 **Corporal Drillman** (90%)

This is a common drill unit booster!

It boosts drill units by 15% damage & 15% lower cooldown! It can still boost non drill units, but only 10% per stat.

🧀 **Cheese Drillman** (9%)

throws cheese at toilet

🎖️ **Sergeant Drillman** (1%)

This Drillman is ranks above the Corporal Drillman!

He boosts for a lot more - 25% per stat! He can still boost non-drill units but by 15% for both stats.

![](https://toilettowerdefense.com/content/images/2024/10/image-3.png)

## **New Drill Pass Tiers**

Tiers 40-60 have been added to the drill pass! Most people still aren't at tier 40 yet, so good luck grinding!

Tier 60 Reward:

👑 **King Cameraman**

The king cameraman uses his magic orb to deal great damage to toilets - and sometimes they can become golden!

This temporarily turns them into solid gold, freezing them for a short period of time.

---

# VIP Gamepass Improvement

Many people have been saying VIP is kind of useless right now, since it only gives 20 gems and a boost every 4 hours.

So, VIP has also been buffed by adding a crate you get every time you claim VIP rewards (every 4 hours if you have VIP!)

## **VIP Crate**

You can get this crate for free every time you claim VIP Rewards in the Spawn!

🤑 **VIP Cameraman** (99%)

This cameraman is very rich! He throws money at toilets. Toilets can't use money because they dont have arms, so instead they die.

💪 **Very Important Titan** (1%)

This titan is too rich for money - it takes up too much space. He has pure gold bars and is very buff from lifting them all day!

Gold is so dense it does tons of damage when he throws it at toilets!

---

# Others

## Sigma Drillman (Exclusive)

do not mess with the skibidi rizz sigma 👿 👿

his ohio mewing aura neutralizes the toilets rizz which mogs them in 360 degrees

You can find him in the Exclusive Shop for **499 Robux**.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

- Clans now show XP until the next level (previously showed the current total xp as the green bar and total bar was total xp for next level, so if you level up, youd still be at - for example - 1m/1.1m and it'd show as already mostly there).
