(The Snowglobe Story, Chapter 4) The queen's hand rested against her cheek, not even bothering to spare her usual icy glare at her kneeling sibling, what was left of her patience had finally frozen solid. Another thorn in her side. She had toiled over piles of etiquette books & glaciers of black ink to climb the mountainous terrain known only in oblivious queries as the royal heir's education, accumulating in her superior station on the cold throne the apple of her parent's eye now begged beneath. Although his sheltered innocence left him unfit for the sheer reality of his existence, he did make an admittedly decent decoration, more easily controlled than her uncivilized stepmother. But who did he have to thank for his appearance? His smooth capelet accented with a smart cravat & symmetrical epaulets wouldn't convince anybody that he had ever served in her military. The garment specifically tailored to meet his measly measurements, he was but a mannequin to exhibit her family's image that had deluded himself as being carved into some sort of sinless savior from the fractals of obscenity her ancestors curated... All because he assisted the poor. Even she spoiled him. Just when she thought what remained of her mother's soul had finally been icebound. Abruptly, she rose. With a sharp whisper, she ordered him to leave, banishing him into the uncharted territory of a careless solstice. When the queen speaks her orders, even the storms circulating above still. His cape ripped from his form, all Nyberg — her reluctant right-hand warrior — could do was watch as he vanished into a deep sea of white snow, never to be seen again. (written by stixxntricks)",

Newly incorporated acoustic technology can now allow an ultimate over-ear wireless experience, with top-notch cushioning noise-cancelling technology catering to any environmental volumes so you can head bang in style, or toggle to hang them from your neck! Internally composed of anodized aluminum, the outer plastic casing provides for greater customization; as the cracked heart can be toggled to be repaired with adorned angelic wings, or a seashell! The conceptual creator of these headphones was reportedly a patron of the musical arts. While they insisted on only utilizing the most brilliant & sound boosting materials that diamonds can buy, & put extra emphasis on user personalization, scarce information exists on this obscure & elusive individual. Some satiny string circles around the hard shell, just above the split in half heart. When unwrapped, the underside displays inky, blotchy black text, barely able to be deciphered...
'(1) as the loathsome loved light leaves
serrated spikes sever uncertain seams
cleaving what you once believed
stare in shock at how sharply sweetness is perceived.'

Internally composed of anodized aluminum, the outer plastic casing provides for greater customization; as the cracked heart can be toggled to be repaired with adorned angelic wings, or a seashell! The conceptual creator of these headphones was reportedly a patron of the musical arts. While they insisted on only utilizing the most brilliant & sound boosting materials that diamonds can buy, & put extra emphasis on user personalization, scarce information exists on this obscure & elusive individual. Some satiny string circles around the hard shell, just above the split in half heart. When unwrapped, the underside displays inky, blotchy black text, barely able to be deciphered...
'(1) as the loathsome loved light leaves
serrated spikes sever uncertain seams
cleaving what you once believed
stare in shock at how sharply sweetness is perceived.'

(The Snowglobe Story, Chapter 1) It was from the noble Aurora's frosted signature longsword that the fiends of the summit were vanquished, proving that even the most meager of peasants can rise above without regal talons to command them prompted an assured outcry from the long mistreated lower class, wherein the unfeeling queen was subsequently dethroned & replaced with a corresponding & caring community. Before peace prospered, the cold queen's knuckles whitened as her control on the people's labored misery splintered under Aurora's influence. She challenged Aurora to a duel. If victory was to be given to the peasant girl, she would release her grip on her people. Leaving only claw marks in her wake. However, if she failed, Aurora would be cast into an uncaring cyclone of the queen's own bewitching creation... Unsheathe this twisting saber & take to heart that some live by the blade & make a martyr out of themselves because of it, but only the most skilled combatants use it as a lifeline. For the astute & quick-witted, the phrase 'dulce et decorum est pro patria mori' is but a tragic lie, she who survived to tell the tale would share it for all to hear; ardent glory is only found with your feet poised & securely planted on the snow trodden battleground, above the steadily sloping abyss of your glacial subterranean grave.

serrated spikes sever uncertain seams
cleaving what you once believed
stare in shock at how sharply sweetness is perceived.'

(The Snowglobe Story, Chapter 5) Once the queen was vanquished, the sharp particles of the blizzard awaiting Aurora embued with her rage hung suspended in the icy air like collapsing comets abruptly stopping in their descent. A twist in the tale states it was not Aurora's blade that brought about her defeat. The untamed & fittingly nicknamed 'Beast of the Blizzard' who dealt her chaotic downfall sluggishly retreated through snowdrifts, & slipped into a profound slumber somewhere deep within the caverns of the summit, attempting to thwart the steadily spreading algor in its chest... While the legends circulate that the monster is no myth, that its blood remains as rigid as the glacial underbelly itself because of the queen's influence, & that its state of cryostasis is preserved to this very day, the last remnants of the one who ruled with a frosted sword begged to be discarded, & thus were left to their resting place in the snowy bed of the white tundra. The jewels from history long gone hail obsolete to the residents, their stares easy-going & lively even while you wear the scattered remains of their sovereignty upon your head. Some fairies may mutter that the shining specter stirs the soul with remembrance as their own faces reflect against the gemstones, but they're not frozen in place, & progress past it. The connections that they make are worth the continuous sculpting, for they're valued far above the embellished ornateness of this coronet. You believe you can pantomime as a ruler while exhibiting this relic without fretting over the possibility of becoming corrupt to the evils that can come along with the title. Regality & the storm it situates will never rest upon your innocent soul, that is an unshakable fate for the far more cold-hearted... This is how you reassure yourself when you hear faint, callous cackling carried close to your ears with the wild winter winds. Perhaps some storms are best left pendulous in the past, but some never truly subside... (written by stixxntricks)",

So profound that she could be whited-out into insignificance amongst the school of pedantic pedestrians that filtered through the cold current known more commonly as the big city... A stray snowflake descended from a torn apart cloud, sticking to the closely-knit fabricated fur of her cossack hat. Similarly to herself, it inevitably melted, lost within the workings of a monotonous mass, but unable to fully immerse itself inside the patterns of the herd while feeling so innately singular. Too wrapped up in their own moments to even share a passing glance with a wonderful woman such as herself while simply strolling down the sidewalk... (written by stixxntricks)"

Even their original packaging showcases attention to care & quality; swirling, shimmering silver scripture against creamy snowflake patterned scenery.

(Tale of Triumph, Part 1)

There was once a time, when peace reigned serenely under the Goddess' gaze. Untethered, she resided in a plane beyond the hands of mortals. The people carefully crafted her likeness, clothed in roses & ribbons or just as frequently as steel & chainmail. In the heart of the capital, the central plaza was always abuzz. Children play and their joy would fill the air under the watchful eyes of an armoured statue of the goddess.

The statue was adorned by several handcrafted necklaces around her neck, and a pale daisy crown sat atop her firm hairline. Child-like doodles were sprawled beneath her feet, declarations of love scribbled in chalk.

It wasn't until the bouquet of flowers left at her feet had wilted after a mere day, that anybody sensed something was amiss. (written by stixxntricks)]],

At this angle, she could get a clearer picture of him. Eyebags lined his eyes, his visage the perfect portrait of an overworked businessman. While she performed the same tired dances on stage every day for an audience that viewed her as a distraction from their own boredom, she imagined he'd be hunched in front of a harsh screen in some cramped cubicle somewhere, rampantly high above the currents of civilization, but still just as uniquely lost within it as she was. As she stared through the settled frost on the glacial glass wall between them, she speculated over the concept of every single individual fish subdued under icy waters foolishly thinking it is somehow specially distinct in its own internal isolation. A sheer chill sliced through the thin lace of her sleeves, & she instinctively crossed her arms as it shook through her frail form, painted fingernails resting against her own bare skin. She had a coat strikingly similar to his, if only she'd remembered it before setting off on her routine that morning... Blinking, her eyes widened in recognition. The stranger she'd been watching was now staring directly at her... (written by stixxntricks)",

See a clearer perspective of yourself in the radiant reflections found within these sharply shaped carvings.

This ring shines brighter than any similarly scoured, for added sorcery has thrown away the need to speculate over sizings, as it can befit any finger & any finery. Its expanding enchantment even enables it to be toggled into a bracelet should its wearer want for one! A discerning recommendation would be to marry this accessory with the similarly sophisticated 'Devoted Diamond Earrings', they make a charming combination of couples! (Written by stixxntricks)",

While she performed the same tired dances on stage every day for an audience that viewed her as a distraction from their own boredom, she imagined he'd be hunched in front of a harsh screen in some cramped cubicle somewhere, rampantly high above the currents of civilization, but still just as uniquely lost within it as she was.

A sheer chill sliced through the thin lace of her sleeves, & she instinctively crossed her arms as it shook through her frail form, painted fingernails resting against her own bare skin. She had a coat strikingly similar to his, if only she'd remembered it before setting off on her routine that morning... Blinking, her eyes widened in recognition.

Once again inspired by elegant & vintage Victorian fashion, this bonnet was crafted following flocks of shepherds being herded towards the 'Versailles Snow Powder Coat' from the same manufacturers due to a sudden rise in popularity, in part to how well they pair up with stylish sheep herder's festive photoshoots. Scrambling at this shining opportunity to lace their pockets, the marketing team turned towards classic Bo Peep interpretations to stitch together this adorable winter bonnet. Intended to be utilized alongside the coat, this adoring headwear also partners up well with almost any other fluffed-up, youthful accessory. Choosing a bold color is highly recommended with this design; your lost sheep won't see you if you're clad in pure white amongst all that snow! (written by stixxntricks)",

The untouchable, transparent tenacity abruptly ascended plant life into its soothingly savage flurry. The spiralling winds intertwined their individual destinies. The steadily shaping circlet of stems curiously captures a collection of discarded, stray feathers from six different doves together on each mirrored tail-end. Following, this transcendental serendipity, by fair means or foul, inexplicably achieves an uncanny resemblance to angelic appendages. in the centre, a symbol of love crystallizes, emanating with pure, unfathomable power. Shaking with enchanted energy, the wind whistles through the flora as it twists & turns above our mortal earth. Has the wellspring blessed you with such an ethereal oddity in acknowledgement of how its clear waters ever show a unique reflection of your innocently, consistently returning self? Or has it sought to overwhelm you with the eeriest, & scarily unexplainable celestial sides of nature, circling all at once?

The once awe-inspiring skyline was as unremarkably extraordinary to her now as each individual narrative that transpired inside each miniature square window of light. She felt herself stop in her tracks. Her eyebrows creased as she searched for an explanation behind her abrupt interruption, people filtered by as though she was just another staple stirred into the splendid scenery that furbished their everyday monotony. Turning her head, she heard it. A song. Hailing from one of the nearby stores that neared its closing hour. Discreetly gasping, the sharp air stung her throat. The firm bow that kept the upper half of her clothing closed scratched against her skin, seemingly constricting, although she knew it could easily be removed. The ribbon wrapped around her waist copied, squeezing her stomach, she found herself wishing the weather wasn't so darn cold so she could at least remove her outer shirt during this terse intensity. Inhaling, she accumulated these snaking sensations, then expelled them with a sizeable sigh. Staring through steadily cascading snowflakes, a man inside caught her eye.

They seem to draw any attention away from your face & onto themselves instead, as they should. They are the most important & captivating aspect of your outfit, of course. While wearing them, you cannot evade agonization; surely their stoutly extending clasps are too stubby? & you run the risk of them descending onto the disgusting dirt below? That won't do. You may find it best to put them in an exhibition if you're fittingly fretting over the possibility of mistreating them. Such captivating chartreuse needs to be kept safe & sound... As gleeful gaiety reverbed against the enticing emeralds lading this open & exposed vein, the gaggle of miners raised their pickaxes to excavate these precious ores... Then stopped, mid-air. They strained, sweat dripping from their skin, unable to bring themselves to lower their grimy equipment. The jewels shone brightly - they felt themselves growing green with envy towards such undeniable, unobtainable virtue. As the group of miners at long last took a hike out of the literal goldmine almost empty-handed in credit to their sudden stop, they salvaged some adrift glorious gems from their ghastly gear that annoyingly arcanely resistant elves scrounged together to structure into 3 sets of jewelry. Understandably unable to miss out on the opportunity to parade such bewitching wonders... (written by stixxandtricks)",

Its purpose was always meant to simply uplift apparel? Mayhaps, long ago, it belonged to a stylist beyond their time at the brink of the new millennia... Delicately weaving a thin ribbon adorned with a demure daisy clip around the base... Someone so strikingly similar to yourself. The branching pathways of possibilities speak of the timelessness of the 'newsie cap' style. Worn by the wealthy & working-class alike in the early 20th century, this hat also saw a resurgence in popularity in early 2000's hipster culture. Maybe it may pave new trends onto the runway yet again if it's been considerately upcycled into your care!

When ice governs all, you may not even notice that you've managed to make a home within the center of the storm. The prologue of the past permeates but is nothing is everlasting. The queen always had the choice to relinquish her talons.
Pre-teen princess Cassandra beheld a realm whose inhabitants no longer had a firm foundation from behind a splintering sheet of fanciful glass. A world without structure, or a heavy yet steady hand after the cold king had crumbled. Clasps clicking reverbed against the imposing walls of the palace's open foyer. As her stepmother shiveringly smoothed out her coat, Cassandra kept control.
'Right, that's it, I'm all packed.'
She spoke, a ghost of a smile on her face.
A glacier of silence. Cassandra sat on the window seat just behind the throne, while her matriarch could hardly see her from the only angle the ground below provided.
' ... Cassandra, you will look at me when I am speaking to you.'
The woman's words were stern, used to obedience. Inhaling the sharp air, the soon-to-be queen's lifetime so far accumulated inside her mind like the shards of snow compiling across the pane, a storm was starting to settle. Cracks had chipped into the royal public image within this skittish replacement parent's feeble clutches.
Shaking her head, the stepmother clenched the ornate handle of her suitcase, her carriage loomed, & she would not lend this insolent brat another second of her time.
'Await my return. Keep up your studies. The crown awaits a clever queen...'
Scoffing, heels clattered unceremoniously against the polished marble.
'Not one with her head stuck in the clouds.'
That night, Cassandra was stirred by servants. Stepmother's carriage had skidded off a slope during the seething tempest that had snowballed overnight, luggage littering the cliff was recovered, but nothing else.

The room sled down into a cold, still silence. The citizens stared as a teardrop cascaded down her cheek... When she felt a hand tap the rippled & regal fabric on her slumped, sinking sleeves. Eyebrows scrunching together, she turned to come face to face with the compassionate eyes of another contender; a baking fairy, armed with a warm smile that was calmly considerate enough to thaw through even the iciest of situations. Gently asking Princess Peppermint why she was sobbing, she tearfully explained, snickering with a sour snicker at how foolish & forgetful she was to be in her current circumstances. She sighed, stating that she was as ‘scatterbrained as a snickerdoodle’. The fae told her not to fret. Producing a cutting board from their station, they handed the Princess their spare. Another contestant approached, gingerly offering her their selection of backup cookie cutters... Eventually, with the contestant's combined efforts, she felt like a kid in a candy store, for they had cooked up a full set of baking equipment! Elated, she enveloped the group just as the judges strolled through the doors. Princess Peppermint was awarded the silver medal for her circular, smooth peppermint creams, yet she felt like the true victor as she had received the sweetest treat she'd ever tasted; coordinated, collective culinary kindness... These sleeves are a close copycat of the material she exhibited that miraculous evening! Sloping & serene, they're the festively lax & final missing puzzle piece to complete a stylish visage! Wear them with a corset or without, you'll feel lavish even in loungewear by letting them loosely spin around your skin & sprawl over your forearms!

For even that which glimmers & shimmers in the night sky finds itself lonesome sometimes, so in thanks for adding to the constellations, they then shot down from astronomical heights followed by this flourishing fabric, heaven sent from the astronomical astrals above! The cathedral then crumbled without the pathfinder, its grandeur subdued within the grandiose galaxy... The lustre of the illuminated is alight by bright ideas; legend says a false flowercrown will be given as an additional virtue, & the veil itself is rumoured to be able to adjust to those of different heights. The majesty of the magical material also allows ample space for a flowercrown & veil combo if 2 'Celestial Cathedral Veil's are equipped together! How ceaselessly stylish our stars are!

Internally composed of anodized aluminum, the outer plastic casing provides for greater customization; as the cracked heart can be toggled to be repaired with adorned angelic wings, or a seashell! The conceptual creator of these headphones was reportedly a patron of the musical arts. While they insisted on only utilizing the most brilliant & sound boosting materials that diamonds can buy, & put extra emphasis on user personalization, scarce information exists on this obscure & elusive individual. Some satiny string circles around the hard shell, just above the split in half heart. When unwrapped, the underside displays inky, blotchy black text, barely able to be deciphered...

serrated spikes sever uncertain seams
cleaving what you once believed
stare in shock at how sharply sweetness is perceived.'

Bracing themselves, the adults gawked in fear as the dusty red curtains split... To shockingly unveil that a group of fallen angels, dressed in gaudy sweaters & cardboard divinity, had filled their tiny schoolhouse to the brim. No longer speechless, these visitors cheered & clapped in unknown & unheard-of hurrahs that thundered over the clamoring cyclone outside. When small actors took their final bows, a warm glow enveloped the flightless friends, soon melting like snow, it revealed genuine halos & feathers in place of the thoughtful fakes, while the clouds outside parted to release a soft sunset after a taxing wintertide. Approaching the stage, the youngest, who hadn't quite grown into their real angelic features yet, placed a hooped headband & artificial wings onto one of the local children in unspoken gratitude. Shooting across the sky, they flew far beyond snowfall. Higher & higher until they were once more just mere specks in their night sky, soaring where they once plunged. This constructed halo is easy to make. It stands on shaky stalks, & is as delicate & fragile as snowflakes themselves, but that is what makes it so precious. A handed-down keepsake from long, long ago, only obtainable through special means... You find yourself feeling just a little bit kinder whenever you wear it. (End) (written by stixxntricks)"

When twin favorable fashionista fairies finally happened upon Snowglobe Summit in the faraway past, they were stunned into silence at the sight of the woolen sweaters & patched-up snow pants that could be observed around the most joyous of realms! With compliments such as 'unique' & 'modest' leaving their hesitant lips alongside awkward chuckles, they swiftly set off to work on their very own fashion exhibition for the domain. Continuously contending that it was 'necessary' & a 'matter of integral stylistic moral importance'. The citizens eagerly assisted in their flights of fancy, allowing themselves to be as spruced-up as the decked-out cedar trees were for the season, dressed to the nines by the two determined designers. The situation was looking direr than they ever could've dreamed; the weather meant that the populace's ensembles would need to be both radiant & able to house additional heat. As the frost was beginning to thaw, the youngest groaned after yet another long day with nothing to show for it, her hair tousled with eyebags lining her vibrant eyes, while her sibling simply kept staring at her deserted design sheet. Slowly, the eldest sister's expression lit up as rays of steadfast sunlight shined through the stormily clouded recesses of her thought process... Eureka! There would be a show after all!

(A Celestial Story) (Chapter 1) When celestial bodies plummeted from the stratosphere, residents of a certain chilly town stirred with excitement as they scrambled to seek out these once illuminated wonders... But were aghast to discover that the remains of what they believed to be breathtaking falling stars were actually fallen angels who had been traversing above the realms. Dazed, they awoke in a world light-years beyond their own. Without a diamond to their name & their robes charred, their very wings scorched from their backs, their halos burnt to ash from their accidental descent, they found that all the memories they had of their home were just bygone echoes scattered across the void of space. These wordless observers watched the locals as they excitedly welcomed impassive strangers into their homes, stared silently as they were encouraged to take their place at the dinner table although they had never-hungry stomachs, & blinked at the scratchy sweaters the eager & enthusiastic elders had knitted to cradle their static skin. Those who dedicate patience to nurturing the meaning of the season may find themselves earning this pair of wings. Although imitation, they're worth more than divinity to a collection of once lost souls. The children of that particular town constructed these wings. Putting their care into every pretend feather, & leaving their hearts on their sleeves when shakily trailing drying sticks of glue down simplistic fragments of flimsy cardboard. When offered to humbled outsiders, their icy expressions finally broke. It's just children's arts & crafts, but it was enough to make seraphs sob. (written by stixxntricks)",

Concentrated aquatic sorcery whilst buried beneath the ocean for several eras & naturistic earth magic from sands unsullied by mortals has caused the coiling of shells, jewels, & doubloons. Centuries past, & now this circlet of long forgotten treasure & untamed energy has been summoned forth to be your halo. Foam forms within its core, a forever flowing free shoreline unshackled by the laws of the lunar cycle or the tumultuous torrent, its power endlessly threatening to overflow. It nearly makes you seasick to let your mind wander to whether such an item was a reward or an accursed omen, but then you recall that dead men tell no tales, so perhaps it is best to not question the ways of the waters.

This includes highlighting any articulate artistry that may be inked onto their skin. It is for this purpose that they can be swiftly detached & toggled in multiple ways; including their original state, sleeves without the tattoos, sleeveless arms with strings & without tattoos, & bare arms with tattoos.

Internally composed of anodized aluminum, the outer plastic casing provides for greater customization; as the cracked heart can be toggled to be repaired with adorned angelic wings, or a seashell! The conceptual creator of these headphones was reportedly a patron of the musical arts. While they insisted on only utilizing the most brilliant & sound boosting materials that diamonds can buy, & put extra emphasis on user personalization, scarce information exists on this obscure & elusive individual. Some satiny string circles around the hard shell, just above the split in half heart. When unwrapped, the underside displays inky, blotchy black text, barely able to be deciphered...

serrated spikes sever uncertain seams
cleaving what you once believed
stare in shock at how sharply sweetness is perceived.'

 (Tale of Triumph, Finale part 4) 

Soon, the sun itself went away. The kingdom's days had become colorless & barren. An uneasy atmosphere filled the deserted streets. All the shops & vendors had closed. The food was pale, the plants wilted, a bowl of fruit in the king's bedroom had turned to soot & was left there to remind him of time, & how little was left of it for their home. The chalk butterflies underneath the Goddess' statue had been smeared into white, bulbous smudges that resembled nothing, unrecognizable in their chaotic emptiness. A world silent, the very life of a nation stilled, occupied by people waiting for any sign of hope...

The head researcher swirled a vial of medicine, ignoring the king, who paced the stone floor of what was once the castle dungeons, but was now home to a laboratory. 
"I cannot comprehend it happening here. Why? For what reason? Why do we deserve this? Our people were peaceful, well fed, innocent..."
He trailed off upon turning to see the researcher frowning at him before rolling their eyes.
"This hasn't happened because of anybody's lack of care, sire. Nor because it was deserved. I have heard of this, far away & long ago. I'd heard it whispered as if it were a disturbing secret & accusers ostracized. There's no preparation. We simply do what we must to fight it."

A plump plushie of a petite & prim penguin, patched together with passion & prudence presumably by one of Snowpoint Summit's elders! Star accentuated eyes squashed shut & his flippers posed to stifle a sheepish giggle, his embarrassed blush is so compelling that you cannot resist smiling whenever you set your sights on him! You found this little fellow sticking out of a snowbank, alone, adrift, & without his waddle anywhere around. After some considerate scrubbing, he's now as clean & pristine as a flightless bird's sleek & streamlined feathers! Supposing that a child may have accidentally dropped him, you placed posters & asked around the realms to try & identify his owner, as you've received no reply, he seems to be permanently in your protection! Senior citizens might stop you on your strolls encircling Snowpoint Summit, citing that the sewing pattern used to construct his pudgy form was a standard staple of the realm in their youth. They may mumble to you an endearing rumor that they believed as children; so it goes, each penguin plushie has a heart-shaped pebble placed inside its stuffing, & it's said that if it's carefully squeezed tightly enough during the coldest night of the year, it may start to emit a soft & soothing glow...

Endless possibilities are exemplified by the ceaselessly changeable characteristics, even down to switching the spikes on the choker in for a steel heart; each torso on the feminine style can have the skirt detached, while each skirt can also be worn separately to each bodice too! While little is known about the secretive stitcher of this outfit, their work seems to speak to shapeshifters in immeasurable emotional volumes. They certainly seem to understand how to market to be many-sided. Inspecting your new skirt or shirt, you may notice a label folded within the silky & smooth creases. One side displays a white set of seraph wings, the other is severed down the centre with inky black stitches. Small text aligning each side of the illustrated seams has you squinting to read it;
'(2) separate tails of the same chain intertwine

strain to be twice as tensely tight
as the space between us stretches into the night.'

Upon returning to Earth, the starry eyed wanderer walked through a world without wonder. Muted in comparison to the spectacle of space, they stepped across continents as if striding to their own wake, a silent observer spoiled by the stars & sadly swept up by the endless epiphany of an eternal universe. During a meteor shower, cascading stardust formed a bouquet of interstellar lillies in their gloomy grip, charity for the loss of charm caused by the majesty of the cosmos. The card attached to the stems twinkled when it was twisted at the right angle to reflect light. A message from a mourning side of the stars simply stated;

 (Tale of Triumph, Part 7)

The king hastily ran to the laboratory upon hearing the news, risen from another night of tossing & turning. He ran downstairs, boots pounding against the floor. The head researcher grasped at his shoulders as he opened the doors. The room echoed with scientific chatter as the researcher explained the situation. There was a cure, but just like the process, it would not work by itself. Whoever was willing to channel the cure, would likely be overwhelmed by the abundance of energy & power needed to do it. The king's gaze hardened, for they must do what is needed. What could be a more noble cause?

Citizens circled the barren plaza as their ruler stood in the middle. In one hand he held a small vial of golden liquid, while in the other he grasped his iron broadsword. Wide-eyed, the crowd stood & watched as he raised his sword, popped open the vial and suddenly a light appeared from him so bright they could no longer see.

The Goddess' statue had shattered into a thousand pieces, leaving pure light fading in its place. There stood a woman. Wearing lace & ribbons, in an elegant gown which pooled onto the white ground. She raised her parasol & she declared in a cool & commanding tone…

"To that which has entered our domain & sought nothing but evil & despair. This cowardice shall be struck with our majesty, summoned & strengthened by the courage & conviction of all mortals. I will battle on even when the people feel too weak to fight for themselves. No lives will be affected here at the hands of this evil, ever again. Farewell."

In a concluding flash of light, they blinked through their blotted vision to find their kingdom restored. The statue of the Goddess perfect & undamaged, risen from the ashes where its ruins once remained, only this time, represented in regal, single-hooped ribbons & lace.
Days turned into months after the tumultuous banishment of the kingdom's strife, & although life was never quite the same, and while the memory of the hardships resonated, it also brought them closer. Alliances had been formed with their charitable neighbors, and the fundraising would not stop, nor would the celebrations. The head researcher bid farewell to their monarch as they searched for faraway lands to spread knowledge of their experiences there, to seek more cures. Those who swam under the ocean & those who soared far above the clouds had heard of this affliction. It was fought & won in this instance, but the fight for a better tomorrow wasn't over. The king's personal seamstress who saw the savior's miracle had a burst of inspiration for their next collection, proceeds would be donated to charity. The land was most harmonious within the plaza, the statue of the Goddess had been transformed. Now, she was posed in an elegant gown with her parasol raised. A new plaque had been installed beneath her now heeled feet, surrounded by chalk circles of plump butterflies & a flight of devoted doves.

It has permeated much longer than the suffering the rulers brought about while towering inside the altitudinous eye of a soundless storm of sorrows. Unfortunately, some pieces of the past still remain intact even upon impact. With the last royal & thus the knowledge of how to undo the encasing curse whited-out, the citizens are unable to be fully free from their shackles. The town remains unreachable in the stratosphere during any non-holiday, but they refuse to be frozen like toys inside a glass globe. While the residents once festered in cynicism, their goodwill eventually flourished into a hallmark of the once harsh land, which is now renowned as a tourist attraction during their fleeting festive freedom. In the wintertide after the regal demolition, they would learn about how the world enjoys winter, expanding their small worldview by eagerly welcoming strangers. To a town that had never celebrated life, how a candle is added to an alight Menorah, how kente is coated by dedicated Kwanzaa decorators, how the star on the Christmas tree shines, & many more, seemed more magical than a queen could ever be. Perhaps the cold could be forgiven, even after being twisted under the control of careless hands. This tiara captures a collection of the Northern Lights that cycle the summit's peak, gradually grouped by fractals of mystical residue that collided due to the change in attitude around the climate. As the sphere shattered, the seasonal spirit caused its shards to remain in the sky. Sculpted by its environment, a circlet of kindness crystallized by the same sorcery used to mistreat convinces the Aurora Borealis surrounding it to stay. You cannot stop considering the woes of winter, & how those misfortunes were shaped into warm welcomes while wearing it. Is this aureole a reminder of human compassion, or is it a caution to never become corrupt to the callousness a crown such as this can exemplify? (Written by stixxntricks)",

Hailing all the way from French craftspeople, no expenses were spared on the precise stitching on neither the lax neckline & fringe fuzz nor the silky ribbons! Contrastingly, perhaps you may find that the most detailed above all else is the accuracy of the craftwork on the swirling & shining steel embellishments, for any frills added to finery must at least be on par with a princess's gown! Surprisingly, around the realms, this particular accompaniment has proven itself popular amongst stylish shepherds posing with their flock for a late winter photoshoot. Pleasantly puzzled advertising teams attribute its surge in popularity in part to the endless array of striking colors it's sold in, as they stand out against the snow, & their steadfast stitchers, putting their all into ensuring each individual thread finds itself a place on this cushioned yet extravagant caped coat!

Not only is the interior lined with fleecing for extra warmth & additional cushioning measures should you take a tumble, but it also appears to be imbued with potent magic that enables it to conduct its celebrational spectacles. Discovering this carrier next to a chimney one wintery night besides some heavily settled-in reindeer hoof prints, it doesn't require a stretch of your creativity to realize who its original owner most likely is. Unfortunately, you do not have the connections to make straightforward contact with jolly ol' St Nicholas himself, so it's looking increasingly likely that you'll have to wait for him to seek you out... Or, more daringly, take up the gift-giving duties yourself this season! Spirited confidence instills you while you attach this sack to your strong shoulders, you notice that despite being jam-packed, it is as light as a turtle dove's flawless feather. Perhaps it is indeed possible that you can fill in St Nick himself's shining snow boots & become the purveyor of Christmas... (written by stixxntricks)",

Their bodies are carefully carved out with high-quality cookie cutters to cast their expressive, eager shapes. Contrastingly colored sections of clay are then bundled up & forged onto their forms to create their characterizing accents, even down to their dainty, bite-sized buttons. The craftspeople are often quizzed over their small, sweet smiles & dough-dropped eyes, as they are considered the most strenuous step in the recipe to get correct, but they exclaim that they'll never consider biting the biscuit, for each earring is never deserted, only continuously exerted over until it looks good enough to eat! After the oven has been preheated to 225º & they're certain they are as flat as a pancake, much like real desserts are, they are then placed in a toasty oven on a wafery baking sheet for precisely 10-12 minutes so their clay may harden, all the while being strictly monitored for any signs of burning by cautious bakers. Pliers are then utilized to thread the hook in their then gummy foreheads, & after some time left to cool in the frosty air, the grand process is complete! The credits then roll over a duo of adorable doughy delights that have just been cooked up into creation on-screen! (written by stixxntricks)",

(Tale of Triumph, Part 5)

The mantra among the researchers became to seize the day before it seized them, as time worked against the cause. The barrenness spread to more and more of the farmland, the surrounding meadows, & even the running water of the nearby river itself ceased to flow in the clutches of chaos. The citizens stayed inside, for leaving meant seeing a world in grey & white, & facing a dying landscape with an empty stomach & dry throat. As the mortals held their breath they waited for a change, the sun, a sign, anything.... the world hung in suspended silence. Until a sign did indeed find them. Over the horizon, the king observed flickering, approaching lights contrasted against another gloomy grey dawn. The distant sounds of trumpets & string instruments were carried on the faint winds. He raced to the entryway of the city, where he gazed out to see a parade. Their neighboring kingdom had come in droves. With streamers & banners, with golden & lavender knights atop stern zebras, with food, drink, music... & a float clad in bright ribbons in all the colors of the rainbow, all tied in one loose loop. They had finally come, the king now knew there was hope. If they could rally this support, who else might join? The king melted into the crowd and so did others of the city. United, the parade marched onwards, the citizens of the afflicted city mingling with their new friends. They traveled together across high hills and tall mountains, through rain and the long-desired sunshine, until they reached the land's edge. The sounds caused the merpeople to rise from the ocean, & after hearing of their blight, the merfolk gave the adventurers their word that they would spread word of their cause far & wide below the blue, to all the creatures of the sea.

The group then marched onward to a distant city. After declaring the reason for their venture into the city, even the aloof city-goers parted to let the parade pass through the streets, many joining them on their journey or offering supplies. Onwards they trekked to the castles in the north, occupied by a noble court whose wealth far surpassed the king's own wealth. Impressed by their passion and desire for good, the nobles threw their jewels & finery into a cart, gifting it to their cause. As night fell, the residents & their ruler marched back towards the kingdom without color. In the kingdom's square, the thin breeze picked up; dry twigs & debris swirled in the air before crumbling to ash... A crack etched onto the Goddess' stone mirage. Slowly, assuredly, the malignant ailment spread, splitting the carving apart. (written by stixxntricks)]],

You're almost tempted to rip them off & keep that gorgeous green encased within the safe confines of a glass box forever, securely safe to be stared at for centuries more. You should decide upon this one day. It is the most upright, unblemished option you have... When eavesdropping, irritating elves closed in on the cavern out of pesky curiosity, they apparently unearthed compelling conjuring at play. Allegedly, the jewels were able to hypnotize the minds of those around them, able to stop those with feeble-minded desires of chasing the rainbows of their needless monetary worth aside. Instead, they claimed that they instilled an urge to protect, defend, & compliment their luster into those close by, bending observers to their unexplained inclinations as though they were a malleable mineral such as gangling gold. This was regarded quite rightfully as the balderdash that it is to the dumb denizens. While these emerald's power is likely profound, it is evidently innocuous. You should really decide on what they deserve. They demand to be applauded, but not on your person. You should put them in a case for all to see & where they can be cherished.

While even coal shines under sunlight, they discovered that all that truly glitters is indeed gold, or even better than it, for this rendered their standard excavations unexciting & dull in contrast. Although it was paltry in comparison to the green, their irises glistened as the admittedly meager ore caging the verdant jewels close to the craggy rocks reflected against them.

The night foregoing Aurora's battle, the air sat temporally still, humidity rare for the climate now dense in the stale air that can only be breathed in the eve before combat. Tossing & turning, sleep circumvented her. A befitting comparison to how she feared her blade would evade her frighteningly formidable opponent's reach. She would have to get close. Surely then, it was her own personal failings at being unable to handle the prospect of this — & undoubtedly not the repetition of a swinging iron hammer — that finally caused her to throw her bedsheets from her sweaty form. Descending the stairs to the forge, she witnessed the queen's most loyal warrior casually chipping away at a mighty yet majestic weapon beneath his thick, rugged hands. Hesitantly, she approached, as an outcasted animal inches towards an outstretched hand. Closer. Shifting, Nyberg effortlessly spun a newly constructed ornate battle axe into her firm grip. Reparation, an apology... Is what the ice fairies would call this. But she was never so easily swayed by finery. Blinking, she scowled at its body that she found needlessly swirled & gaudy... This was the handiwork of the queen's right hand alright, never skimming over the quality & the details. He trudges near, as animals do, & pats a rough hand against her strong shoulder. Calloused, but ready to rise above callousness. Shaped by her majesty's summit, but not frozen because of it. In words only a soldier who predicts imminent defeat can utter, he mumbles to her. 'Hvars þú böl kannt, kveð þú þér bölvi.' On the climatic dawn of the duel, Nyberg was standing by Aurora's side, the queen's soldiers, servants, & subjugated subjects closely trailing.

Newly incorporated acoustic technology can now allow an ultimate over-ear wireless experience, with top-notch cushioning noise-cancelling technology catering to any environmental volumes so you can head bang in style, or toggle to hang them from your neck! Internally composed of anodized aluminum, the outer plastic casing provides for greater customization; as the cracked heart can be toggled to be repaired with adorned angelic wings, or a seashell! The conceptual creator of these headphones was reportedly a patron of the musical arts. While they insisted on only utilizing the most brilliant & sound boosting materials that diamonds can buy, & put extra emphasis on user personalization, scarce information exists on this obscure & elusive individual. Some satiny string circles around the hard shell, just above the split in half heart. When unwrapped, the underside displays inky, blotchy black text, barely able to be deciphered...
'(1) as the loathsome loved light leaves
serrated spikes sever uncertain seams
cleaving what you once believed
stare in shock at how sharply sweetness is perceived.'

 (Tale of Triumph, Part 6)

The additional medicinal scholars brought about by the parades noted in their investigations that if just one malignant flower in the meadow was afflicted, it would steadily stretch outwards until it had swallowed up the entire field. Huddled in a group around carefully arranged wilting rose bushes within a once splendid garden, the scientists discussed seemingly ceaselessly with the old lady who once happily watered the flowers on her property... She could not imagine a more upsetting sight. If they were not curious & passionate individuals, eager to open minds to their work, they might have found her irksome. Instead they found her enlightening. Although she seemed startled & concerned, their calm nature & truthfulness kept her collected & earned her respect. They appreciated the opportunity to talk about their work; most saw it as such a ghastly matter, not wanting to hear about such sad things. She was quick to answer, and so long as she stayed to listen, they tended to her worries. Even the healthiest and most well kept of her flowers could be impacted by the malignant ailment. With the laboratories of the kingdoms now bustling, the lead researcher finally felt free to breathe a sigh of relief... Before a knight rushed into the chambers, panting & causing heads to turn. They carried a golden scroll with them. Inscribed was a short & sweet message from the other kingdom, their charitable neighbors. The words made the head researcher's blood quicken.

Today, she'd sauntered down numerous roads, kept herself afloat & adrift amongst a torrential shower of city-goers, & played the part of the prancing performer who let the public water down the artistry of her work into fitting background noise. Not once today had anybody looked directly at her instead of straight through her as though she was as mind-numbingly entertaining as the shallow snow piling up under her feet. Reminding herself to be careful what she wished for, she huffed, ripping her head away from his line of sight, just as a drained, yet trying smile plastered itself on his face. Despite what had just transpired, she found herself unable to move, glazed over. The song would end soon, & she would still be chasing the infantile illusion she had of simply uncovering its title when she knew even the melody would eventually repress itself into some cold corner of her brain. It was odd, she pirouetted above & beyond the eyes of thousands of onlookers a day, she should be higher than this by now. Time seemed to quicken as though it was mocking her, the sleek sliding doors of the store opening, the man stepped out, as so many others did that day. Fiddling with a sole strand of fancy yet faux fur on her muff, dangling from some string wrapped around her neck, she bit the inside of her cheek as the stranger started to venture out of view, turning the corner...
