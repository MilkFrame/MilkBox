A book of poems, no doubt. These were scattered everywhere. It seems like this place was one of solitude, and thought.


You keep flipping the torn pages, trying to find the start of any sentence, an ending to a story. 


But they’re all left in pieces. Left in eternal limbo.

CITIZENS TURNED MONSTERS 
  Macabre City’s nearby town Crest Falls, was put under lockdown after several reports of radioactive substances found in the water supply. The radiation is causing residents to mutate into “unrecognizable husks of their former selves” as our scientists say. Their records show that any living being that comes into contact with the disease loses all traces of emotional stimuli, as their bodies contort, sprouting arthropod features and instincts. 
  The mutation spreads like the plague as officials report, as over 20,000 residents have been found mutated. Tests suggest these “bug-people” have lost their minds, as they infest and trudge through the remains of the city. As of now, the effects are irreversible, and the government is left with no choice but to send extermination teams to terminate the mutated citizens as they pose a danger to society.
  To friends and families of the people of Crest Falls, do not attempt any sort of contact, the risk of an outbreak is too high. Anyone or anything that has escaped from Crest Falls, will be hunted down, regardless if they are a “bug-person” or not. Please report to the nearest authorities if you or a loved one has come in contact with these chemicals, as they will be dealt with shortly.

By subtracting where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.
In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.
The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.]],

i dont have these floppies with me anymore! 

things like this tend to happen when me and prototype(my friieend) are doing business promotions or MANAGERIAL TACTICS. 

if you're reading this, ive officially enlisted you to find all of the lost floppies for me and to keep them because ive lost all care or connection to them.
theyre probably scattered around in weird places so good luck finding them at all.

“Good Evening everybody! This is the ‘Blocks 4 U’ tonight show! We’re here with media sensation and architectural icon, Wallter Brickstone! He’s come here tonight to endorse a long-time sponsor of the show. Take it away, Mr. Brickstone!”

“Oh the pleasure is all mine! But I must confess, the ‘e’ in Brickstone is silent, haha!”

“Wow, I didn’t know you were so humble with your lineage! So tell me Wallt, what’s so good about this Gray… well, ‘Stuff’?”

“It’s quite simple really! As both a partner and soon-to-be manufacturer of the drink, I can indubitably tell you that it’s proven to be the number one benefactor of durable skin! I mean, look at me!” 

Scag Note: a laugh sign went off for the crowd (pibby failure)

“Truly impacting stuff! Onto the next question, let’s get personal!”

“Oh wonderful! I’d love to share a bit of my interests, hobbies, and-”

“Mr. Brickstone, there’s been multiple reports of a scandal involving you! Do you care to say any words about a specific… lumber company you’ve been involved with?”

“Uh-uhm… This wasn’t really what I agreed to discuss… but actually yes! There was quite a tussle with an… old friend of mine’s company. We had our disputes, as you do with a cement entrepreneur as myself, and y-yes, his admittedly small business did close their doors, but I assure you, I had nothing to do with it.”

“I have my doubts Wallter! It seems like after you had allegedly, let’s see here… ‘behind closed doors, Brickstone sabotages smalltime competition’, things really took a dark turn for them!” 

“…Oh that paparazzi, always twisting the truth! Let’s be very serious here, I have a deep regard for any architectural property, of any material! But as a hard-working man such as myself, it’s very easy for competitors to spread lies about their adversaries! Especially when you consider how competitive the market is for lumber, things start to make a lot more sense.”

“While I'm sure you feel that's an acceptable explanation Mr. Brickstone, a wide majority of journalists disagree.”

“That's unfortunate to hear.”

WELCOME 
We’re glad you’re here.

The ████ ██ █████ ████ hopes this bulletin finds all our faithful followers in good health, and otherwise, may it prosper you towards such with the delightful news we have to share.

As you all know, we have been looking for a █████ to appease divinity for a long time, and we have FINALLY found it – The Perfect Body, The ONE.
We at ████ ██ █████ ████ would like to thank everyone who has partaken in our gifting ceremonials up to this point - Thanks to you, No parting has been in vain.

Distressingly enough however, The One has escaped our grasp and seems hesitant to accept their blessing. We are conducting a search throughout all of our facilities, and expect everyone to stay on high alert until fate takes its course. Our great host has used it’s divinity to shield The One until a resolution comes forth.

Further details will be exposed at our next gathering. We hope you take pride in your positions.

WE URGE ALL TO SPREAD OUR MESSAGE TODAY, AND FOREVER FORTH, UNTIL THE ONE IS CAPTURED FOR THEIR HIGHER PURPOSE. THE DAY OF RECKONING IS NIGH UPON US.
Until our days part ways, may ██████ never lead us astray.

Blessings,
████ ██ █████ ████.

Location: Macabre City Prison Facility
Occupation: N/A
Prosecution: Crest Falls contaminate and escapee. General criminality and theft.
Sentence: Lifetime


Prison Report:
Days 1-90: Radioactive tests and depressurization procedures, prisoner found to not be contagious, further experimentation required in hopes to develop a cure.

Days 91-145: Small signs of frustration and lack of sleep occur due to constant testing procedures. Cure not found, continue tests as planned.

Days 156-321: After nearly reaching a year, prisoner has become physically and mentally disturbed. Seen talking to own shadow, breaking off mandibles, scraping off flesh, cracking teeth, etc. Biologists enact this as “long-term side effects” though never seen within an infected citizen. Advised to bring in a medical doctor.

Days 322-365: Commissioned a “Dr. R” to oversee mental improvements within Prisoner 1314, notes are as follows.

Meow meow. Mow. (The patient claims to see a girl in both his dreams and waking stages, and they often speak to each other. As of now, Guest 1314 says that he needs her to be with him at all times, or else he will “get out of line.”)
Mreeeooww, hiss. (After spending a few more days with the patient, he told me that she calls him “Pest”, and has been called this his whole life. He also tells me about his experiences here, although hesitant and, albeit rude at first!)
Mrreeoww meoww. Meow Purr. (After going through the results, I have concluded that I am no longer needed at this facility. Please ensure that prisoner 1314 is left alone in his cell, under no watch, JUST for tonight so he may obtain rest until future experiments.)

Day 366-Present: Prisoner has escaped, and the commissioned doctor is nowhere to be found. Search teams have been tasked daily rounds through the neighboring areas and cities.

—---------------------------------

Dear Dad,
‘Orange’ you glad today is the day!! My first day as the Host of Splitsville! What a ‘fruit-tastic’ opportunity! Being the writer of your show has been so exciting and really fulfilling, but being in your shoes is a real treat! 
However, I can’t help but feel a tad bit of anxiety… Imagining myself in front of that big crowd… my paws are a little shaken from just thinkin about it! I feel like a can-of-worms! I would love for this day to be ‘pear’-fect, to go as smoothly as how I envision it in my head!
…I just hope I don’t mess up, y’know?


Miss you BUNCHES!
Split ^_^

Re: BIG DAY!									11:31 AM
—---------------------------------

Hey there Sugar-Plum! 
Nervous about today? This sounds oddly familiar…. Y’know your old man has been through that exact same situation!  It’s normal to feel that way before performing in front of a big group of people.
Honey, I know you’ll do GRAPE, even if you mess up a couple times, that’s okay, it doesn’t hurt! I happened to slip on my own peel the first day in front of EVERYONE! Hahahaha! Can you believe that? Hearing our guests’ barks and howls was so worth it though!
Everyone is going to LOVE you! Just know I’m your number one fan, supporting you all the way from Joke-O-Rama! Can’t wait to see you live!

Get Crazy! Go Silly! Go BANANAS!
With Love, Foster

To the valuable and loyal employees,
	The Company congratulates you on your hard-earned position in the Power Supply Department. As a reminder, your job is to oversee all active sources that link directly to our other operations, as well as the elevator that filters occupants into inadvertently providing their help towards our causes.
Your jobs are listed as follows:
	-  Make sure all supplies (mannequins, trees, Any biological organisms) are up to quota, and are ready for recycling. If any subjects are unchecked, or have not yet fulfilled their entire use, your local currency will be docked from pay, aside from other punishments.
	-  Oversee all passengers that enter the facility that tend to the power supply process. Use clear instructions and motivational words over the provided loud-speaker to encourage passengers to take part in the supply process. As an incentive, these passengers will be rewarded with our “three dimensional economic enhanced printed goods”.
	-  Make sure all attention is focused on your work for the majority of your work shift. Any slacking or mistakes will not go unseen, nor unpunished.
	-  Remember your place, and understand that any punishment is an act of love and sincerity from the company. You are most important to us, and it is also important that you learn.
We hope you take pride in your new position, and encourage active participation each day. Please sign below to adhere to these responsibilities, and to understand that no organism outside of this establishment shall know of your position at this time.

As a reminder, for the past several months, many of your neighbors have complained of your noise levels, as well as carrying a highly infectious disease, without taking proper care of yourself, or the building. We take this behaviour very seriously, and if continued, we have the right to evict you in safety of your neighbors. Some examples of these instances are quote, “furious gaming”, “wailing in his sleep”, and “shouting his favorite food pastry around the apartment complex.” As you hopefully know, we have given you many warnings, with no desistance from your activities. Please understand that you may be held liable for any and all rules that may be broken during your time renting our floors. 

And please, do not dispose of this letter, we are very sure we have the right name. 

Sincerely and Urgently, 
Ahpar T. Mint

            [[Dear Journal,
It’s now day 2637, or more accurately, two-thousand, six-hundred, thirty seven. It feels a bit more proper in writing. But anyways, today was quite strange. As per usual, I cleaned the floors and dusted the non-livings, but the usual sparse customers today were odd. 

I met a man today. Or should I say, a guy? I don’t really know what to think of him. He was scrawny, and wore a ‘beanie’, he called it. I liked his name though, Kasper had a nice ring to it. Normally I wouldn't pay too much attention to someone who carelessly handled the furniture and bean-bags scattered across the store, but he was searching for something. I asked him if he needed any help, and he was a bit surprised to talk to a lamp. I figured as much. 

He was childish, but friendly. And a bit dumb. He was searching for gaming consoles. In a Rokea store. I reminded him of his idiocy, and told him he would have to search elsewhere in the outside world. He proceeded to tell me, “Yeah dude but like… where? You gotta help a guy out.” I told him I had no clue. He responded, “Well c’mon man, you really don’t seem to get out much. I know a really good bowling alley that we can hang at!” …What was “bowling”? But, he was right. I’ve never gone outside of this store. I spend my days toiling around the non-livings and thinking way too much, but I can’t really help it. 

I passed on his offer, thinking about how uncomfortable it would be to fail in my daily habits. He shrugged, laughed, and skated away on his “heelys.” That’s when I headed back to my ever-changing spot in the mega-store, and left him. I grabbed this book, and then saw him walking to that elevator. I thought about the outside world a bit, and then thought about how carefree he is. What would life even be like if I stepped out of this place? Out of my home? 


Then, like clockwork, the lights turned off. Apparently this Kasper fellow had no track of time, and instead came running back after an employee screeched in his ear. After begrudgingly helping him through the palettes and stairs of the store, he talked my own ear off. I think we spent that whole night talking about what life was about, what it meant to each other, and how we lived. Turns out I’m incredibly “boring” as he says. And turns out he’s incredibly outlandish and has a one-track mind. He also says I write like a “pretentious nerd”, and then laughed it off. One day I’ll detail our conversations in this book, but I had a lot to think about. It’ll be morning soon.  

KASPER WAS HERE LOL

Apologies, I ran to the elevator, and decided to “hang out” with him at this “Bowling Alley”. He will not be touching this book ever again until he washes his hands.

Hi Pilbert P. Caterpillar,

Thank you for your application to the Center Stage Performer position at Clifford Clowning Inc.

Our hiring staff was impressed with your listed skillset. Unfortunately, your in-person audition was less than satisfactory. 

If you ever think of applying to another clowning agency, please try to tell your jokes at an audible volume and not drop your pies on the interviewers laps.

We found your falsified list of talents deeply unprofessional and childish.

You may notice us advertising for similar positions in the future. Please, do not reapply.

Sincerely,

Lou Lou Lofteroney 
Personal director
Clifford Clowning Inc.

Greetings Pilbert P. Caterpillar,

Tini Tino’s Traveling Circus would like to thank you for your time spent in applying for the open position of Chief of Juggling Ring #4. Your in person audition left an impression. The following are words from our company’s founder:

	“...AND TELL THAT LITTLE SCRUNT THAT IF I EVER SEE THEIR PATHETIC, PITIFUL, DEPRESSING, TALENTLESS, DISMAL FACE EVER AGAIN, I’LL…”

The rest of the message was expurgated due to violent language. 

You have not been selected for this position.

Do not apply again.

Sincerely,

Beefy Bjorngino
Personal Director
Tini Tino’s Traveling Circus

I run my bruised and scraped fingertips across each crack, knowing they won't be made whole again.

Sometimes I look towards the one that made me what I have to be. 
Exploring humanity’s imagination, creating great dreams for those to witness. But their hatred was my own undoing. 

Sometimes I peer at the gashes left within me. 
A constant battle of free will and thought, a protector of that which I hate the most. A being of my own torment and malice.



I miss my stars.
